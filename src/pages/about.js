                Armed with an understanding of brain science, child psychology
                and Chinese linguistics (and for older students, exam-taking
                strategies), Hua has developed its own curriculum that makes
                learning Chinese effective and fun at the same time. Hua was
                established in 1992 because of our curriculum director’s passion
                for Chinese and a desire to help children master this
                increasingly useful language.
