                    Armed with an understanding of brain science, child
                    psychology and Chinese linguistics (and for older students,
                    exam-taking strategies), Hua has developed its own
                    curriculum that makes learning Chinese effective and fun at
                    the same time. Hua was established in 1992 because of our
                    curriculum directorâ€™s passion for Chinese and a desire to
                    help children master this increasingly useful language.
