                        All of our preschool programmes are thematic in nature,
                        with a new theme every term. We write our own songs and
                        design our own teaching materials to ensure that
                        children are fully immersed in the theme.

                        Our Primary School Programmes follow the Singapore
                        Chinese syllabus closely. Whilst results are highly
                        important to us, we do not believe in incessant drills.
                        Instead, we seek to keep learning interesting to keep
                        students motivated in learning Chinese. Learning weapon
